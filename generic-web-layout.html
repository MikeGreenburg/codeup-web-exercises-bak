            <p>If you are far from the enemy, make him believe you are near, thus, what is of supreme importance in war is to attack the enemy's strategy, can you imagine what I would do if I could do all I can? All war is based on deception, if you know the enemy and know yourself you need not fear the results of a hundred battles.</p>

            <P><span><h2>Heading</h2></span></P>
            <p>He who is prudent and lies in wait for an enemy who is not, will be victorious, thus, what is of supreme importance in war is to attack the enemy's strategy, invincibility lies in the defence; the possibility of victory in the attack. To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the acme of excellence, can you imagine what I would do if I could do all I can?</p>

            <p><span><h2>Heading</h2></span></p>
            <p>All warfare is based on deception, if our soldiers are not overburdened with money, it is not because they have a distaste for riches; if their lives are not unduly long, it is not because they are disinclined to longevity, regard your soldiers as your children, and they will follow you into the deepest valleys; look on them as your own beloved sons, and they will stand by you even unto death.</p>
